# Earthquake Alerter

![Project Overview](schmatics/Circuit_Diagram.png)

A portable earthquake detection system that alerts users to seismic activities using MPU6050 IMU sensor. This project was developed as part of the EE202 Circuit Theory II course at TED University.

## 🚨 Project Overview

The Earthquake Alerter is a simple, cost-effective seismic sensor designed for widespread implementation. As Turkey is located in an active earthquake zone, this device aims to provide early warning for tremors, potentially saving lives by detecting even minor seismic activities that may go unnoticed.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Detect even minor earthquake jolts
- ✅ Provide audible and visual alerts
- ✅ Offer adjustable sensitivity levels
- ✅ Create an accessible, affordable solution
- ✅ Demonstrate easy earthquake preparedness
